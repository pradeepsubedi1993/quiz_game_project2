# Miles Stone Project 2

 ## Project Overview 
For the second project, I have chosen to develop an interactive quiz game website consisting of 10 questions.
The quiz game is a simple yet engaging way to test the user's basic knowledge on a variety of topics. It presents questions with multiple-choice answers, challenging players to select the correct one. 

The game tracks progress with a progress bar and provides feedback on each answer. Upon completion, it reveals the player's score and offers the option to play again. With its user-friendly interface and diverse set of questions, it's an enjoyable and educational experience for players of all levels.

## Purpose 
It aims to challenge and entertain users while encouraging learning and self-assessment. Whether for self-improvement or entertainment, this website offers an enjoyable way to expand one's knowledge and test their wits. This interactive website is built using HTML, CSS abd JavaScript. 
 
## Main Page

Users can select answers from a list of options provided. The page also includes a progress bar, allowing users to track their advancement within the quiz. A visually appealing image or flag related to the question may be displayed as well. Additionally, users are given the option to navigate to the next question or play again once they have completed the quiz. The first page aims to engage and challenge users right from the start, setting the tone for an enjoyable learning experience.

When players choose the correct answer in this quiz game; 
* The selected answer button turns green, indicating that it's the right choice.
* Additionally, their score increases by one point, and they receive positive feedback.
* The progress bar might also advance, showing their progression through the quiz.
* Players are then prompted to move on to the next question by clicking the "Next" button.

When a player chooses the wrong answer in this quiz game;
* The selected answer button turns red, indicating that it's the incorrect choice.
* Their score remains the same or doesn't increase, and they receive negative feedback.
* The progress bar may not advance or may show limited progression, depending on the game's design.
* Players are also prevented from selecting another answer for the current question once they've made a wrong choice.
* They can only proceed to the next question by clicking the "Next" button.

At the end of the quiz, when all questions have been answered, the player's total score is displayed, typically as a fraction of the total number of questions answered correctly out of the total number of questions in the quiz. This score provides feedback to the player about how well they performed and can be used to determine their level of knowledge or success in the quiz.

In the provided code, the total score is displayed when the quiz is finished, and additional feedback or messages are given to the player based on their score, such as "Well Done, You Scored 10/10!" for a perfect score or other messages for varying levels of performance.

## Testing and Quality Assurance (QA)
**Functionality Testing**: Ensuring all buttons, navigation, and quiz logic work correctly.
**Usability Testing**: Gathering user feedback to improve the website's user-friendliness.
**Security Testing**: Protecting user data and preventing potential vulnerabilities.
**Performance Testing**: Checking that the website loads quickly and handles traffic well.
**Compatibility Testing**: Ensuring it works on various browsers and devices.
**User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Letting real users test the website before deploying.
**Bug Tracking**: Identifying and fixing any issues or glitches.
**Code Review**: Checking the code for best practices and efficiency.

## Code Validation Process 
These are the steps taken during the validation process; 
* HTML: The project was processed through the official W3C validator, and it produced no errors, verifying its alignment with established standards.
* CSS: The CSS code underwent validation through the official (Jigsaw) validator, which identified no errors, ensuring a strong and compliant styling implementation.
* JavaScript: The JavaScript code was validated using jshint.com.

## Website Deployment
* After committing the codes in terminal, the website was deployed using GitHub pages.
