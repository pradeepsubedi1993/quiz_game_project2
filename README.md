 Miles Stone Project 2

For the second project I have chosen to develop an interact quiz game website consisting of 10 quiestions.
My quiz game is a simple yet engaging way to test the user's basic knowledge on a variety of topics. It presents questions with multiple-choice answers, challenging players to select the correct one. 

The game tracks progress with a progress bar and provides feedback on each answer. Upon completion, it reveals the player's score and offers the option to play again. With its user-friendly interface and diverse set of questions, it's an enjoyable and educational experience for players of all levels.

## Purpose 
It aims to challenge and entertain users while encouraging learning and self-assessment. Whether for self-improvement or entertainment, this website offers an enjoyable way to expand one's knowledge and test their wits.
 
## Main Page

Users can select answers from a list of options provided. The page also includes a progress bar, allowing users to track their advancement within the quiz. A visually appealing image or flag related to the question may be displayed as well. Additionally, users are given the option to navigate to the next question or play again once they have completed the quiz. The first page aims to engage and challenge users right from the start, setting the tone for an enjoyable learning experience.
